# md_utils

Tools, utilities, miscellaneous files for chemical simulations (primarily
molecular dynamics) and software development related to the same. Primarily written in Julia. Most of these codes are not optimised
and are built to "just work". Some of these codes don't work yet. Will
incorporate these codes into future projects / repositories.
