# md_utils

Scripts and utilities for chemical simulations (primarily molecular dynamics) and software development related to the same. Primarily written in Julia. Also using this as an experiment to work with Julia as a scripting language. (see : [DaemonMode.jl](https://github.com/dmolina/DaemonMode.jl))


Most of these scripts are not optimised and are built to "just work". Some of these codes don't even work yet. May add these to actual packages later after extensive testing.
